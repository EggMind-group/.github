EggMind explores the next generation of **equality-saturation (EqSat)** optimization by combining classic e-graphs with modern intelligent agents.

## 🚀 What We Do
EqSat optimization traditionally follows three steps:

1. **Represent** a design as an e-graph (`egg`) or database (`egglog`).  
2. **Saturate** the space by running rewrite rules exhaustively.  
3. **Extract** an optimized solution.

While EqSat can theoretically explore the full design space, practical scalability is limited—naive saturation wastes time and memory on irrelevant states.

## 🧠 Our Vision
**Strategy is everything.** We build adaptive, online, and intelligent strategies for EqSat:

- How to apply rewrites  
- When to prune  
- What to analyze

EggMind aims to develop an **LLM-powered optimization agent** that makes these decisions intelligently, improving scalability without sacrificing optimality.
